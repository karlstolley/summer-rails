        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          For the first project, you will independently conceive, sketch, and build the alpha
          version of a Rails app. The app can be anything you believe to be interesting and
          useful. It should have only the most basic functionality and design to be viable; its
          purpose is largely to help you learn to work with Rails and make mistakes. Think of it as
          a proof of concept, both for the app itself, and for your own initial skills in Rails
          development. However, note that for the remaining projects in the class, teams of two
          to three students will develop one of the team members’ app further.

        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          For the beta app, you will work in small teams with one or two other students. Your team
          can either begin again with the app created by one of your team’s members for Project One,
          or develop an idea for a brand-new app. Requirements and deliverables are similar to those
          of Project One; however, you will more fully flesh out the design of your app. It must
          include a way to authenticate users, preferably using an OAuth-based schema.

        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will serve as a subject-matter expert (SME) and resource for other students in the
          class. Your SME area will be one of the core modules of Rails (we will figure this out
          on a thread on Basecamp). You will then review all of the documentation, and read through
          the source code for your module, and post a summary to Basecamp.

            Learn the organization and purpose of Ruby’s and Rails’s core classes and standard

            dependencies
          </li>
          <li>
            Become familiar with the customary practices of the Ruby and Rails communities,
            including those for source formatting, semantic versioning, and configuration
          </li>
          <li>
            Go beyond assigned readings in class and become something of a subject-matter expert
