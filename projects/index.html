        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          For the first project, you will independently conceive, sketch, and build the alpha
          version of a Rails app. The app can be anything you believe to be interesting and
          useful. It should have only the most basic functionality and design to be viable; its
          purpose is largely to help you learn to work with Rails and make mistakes. Think of it as
          a proof of concept, both for the app itself, and for your own initial skills in Rails
          development. However, note that for the remaining projects in the class, teams of two
          to three students will develop one of the team members’ app further.

            GitHub remote repository; Git repository must contain <b>only</b> the files and commits

        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          For the beta app, you will work in small teams. Your team can either begin again with the
          app created by one of your team’s members for Project One, or rework/abandon an idea for a
          brand-new app. Requirements and deliverables are similar to those of Project One; however,
          you will more fully flesh out the design of your app. It must include a way to
          authenticate users, preferably using an OAuth-based schema. <b>Full project description
          will be posted by 6/6</b>.
