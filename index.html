  <h2>Learn Rails</h2>
  <p>
    Take a deep dive into open-source web development powered by Ruby on Rails. This
    production-intensive course covers the practice and applied theory of full-stack web application
    development. You will develop a thorough understanding of model-view-controller architecture
    (MVC), which will be coupled with bespoke database-driven application design, executed through
    object-relational mapping (ORM). Course projects afford the opportunity for you to leverage MVC
    architecture to develop and interact with open data APIs expressed in serialized formats such as
    JSON. You will also engage in mobile-first, responsive interface design using
    standards-compliant forms of HTML, CSS, and the DOM and a suite of a modular preprocessors
    including Haml, Sass, and CoffeeScript.

<section id="principles">
  <h2>The Hard Sell: Take This Class</h2>
  <p>
    Whether or not you have professional ambitions in web development, there are numerous
    higher-level principles and practices that this class introduces:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The professional necessity of tracking the development of active open-source projects
    </li>
    <li>
      Exposure to highly opinionated and uncompromising MVC architecture
    </li>
    <li>
      Full-stack development that closely knits the front- and back-end logic and execution common
      to MVC architecture
    </li>
    <li>
      Mapping user requests and HTTP verbs onto system internals and methods, which leverage the
      capability of modern clients and browsers
    </li>
    <li>
      Intensive work with consoles and loggers to up your debugging game outside of clients and
      browsers
    </li>
    <li>
      Test-driven development (TDD) to ensure code quality and internal consistency, and to
      streamline code reviews
    </li>
    <li>
      Object-relational mapping (ORM) that abstacts away databases and reconciles the set-theory
      behind databases with the structures of classes and methods that drive object-oriented
      programming
    </li>
    <li>
      Continuous integration (CI) as part of robust test-driven development and automated deployment
    </li>
  </ul>

    <p>
      <b>My policy for assigning books:</b> purchase only the edition indicated; the total retail
      pricetag for the entire course should be less than $100 (this one is $99.50 on the high end,
      assuming you opt for the electronic editions and the two optional titles); and each book
      should be worthy of a place on your bookshelf or electronic device of choice long after the
      class has ended.

<section id="projects">
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>
    There will be two major projects in this class. An individually developed prototype alpha app,
    and a group developed beta app culled from the individual alpha apps. Additionally, graduate
    students will be expected to more deeply investigate one of the core Rails framework’s modules
    (e.g., Active Record, Action Cable, Active Support) and serve as in-house consultants on them.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="technology">
  <h2>Required Tech Setup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A Unix-like operating system (Linux, BSD, macOS, etc.). Virtualization is fine, but Windows
      is not.
    </li>
    <li>
      A plain-text editor that highlights Ruby syntax (there is no widely-used IDE for Ruby). If
      you’re an Atom user, you’ll want the Ruby language package for Atom.
    </li>
    <li>
      A command-line Git installation and GitHub account.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Node.js JavaScript runtime.

    <li>
      A Ruby environment, such as rbenv (recommended) or RVM.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Full setup details will be emailed to registered students ahead of the first class meeting.
